      								<h3>Bike association</h3>
      								<ol id="purchasing">
      									<li class="heading">I already own a bike can I associate that with Wicked Ride?</li>
      									<p class="answer">Sorry to say, but currently we are only accepting new bikes for association considering the regulation hassles and also for better customer experience. (I will talk to suchi and see if we can close on existing bike as well)</p>
      									<li class="heading">Why Wicked Ride accept only few models for association?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Based on customer demand, local service network and the massive experience in the bike rental space, we have identified and shortlisted the bikes which we are currently accepting. They will earn good return with lesser maintenance cost. We keep evaluating the list on 5th of every month and open slots for newer models in the market.</p>
            							<li class="heading">In whose name the bike will be registered?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Bike will be registered in the name of Wicked Ride and so will be the invoice. This is only for registration purpose. The complete ownership will be with the investor. We are there to help you with documentation to ensure that you have an easy transfer of vehicle in case you choose to exit the plan.</p>
            							<li class="heading">Will I lose control over the bike as the registration and invoice will be in the name of Wicked Ride.</li>
            							<p class="answer">As per  Motor Vehicles Act, the bike should be registered under the name of lessee. Further, the invoice follows the registration and Wicked Ride will be present on the invoice. But we clearly mention that you are the legitimate owner of the bike and you will have total control over it meaning you can discontinue the association by giving notice based on the agreement signed. The agreement will clearly state that you will be the owner of the bike and you can pull out the bike from association program. The Supreme Court of India has passed a judgment in the case of I.C.D.S. Ltd. vs. CIT (2013) supporting our cause that while the Motor Vehicle Act requires the vehicle to be registered under the lesseeâ€™s name, the owner of the vehicle remains the lessor, So you will be the owner of the bike all the time.</p>
            							<li class="heading">Will Wicked Ride help me secure a loan or should I get my own banker to fund the purchase.</li>
            							<p class="answer">If your bank provides you a two wheeler loan with an NOC and allows it to be registered under Wicked Ride name, then you can go ahead with same, else you can also avail a personal loan to fund the bike. Or we will be happy to help you get a loan with our bank if your profile meets the requirement of the bank.</p>
            							<li class="heading">Should I run around showrooms, RTO office, insurance agents etc to get a bike and necessary permits to associate the bike?</li>
            							<p class="answer">No, Wicked Ride has built a team of experts and will work on behalf of you which will help you book, register, get permits, insurance, RSA, GPS and all subsequent process to keep you free of any running around. Wicked Ride team will update you the process, send a copy all documents for all future references and also help you in case of any doubts about process.</p>
            							<li class="heading">What is the process to be an associate?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Fill up the form and our executive will reach out to you.</p>
            							<li class="heading">Will there be a GPS in my bike? Can I opt out of it? Will there be a monthly cost to it and will I get access to location of my bike?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Wicked Ride will install GPS device and you will be charged at actuals for the same. GPS is must for the safety of the vehicle and also to have a better control over the fleet. The GPS has a immobilizer which will help to shut down ignition remotely. We will provide you a login through which you can track your vehicle movement. Yes, there will be a monthly charge which at times changes based on service provider monthly fees.

This provides an opportunity to both customers and investors to go for new high yielding models which are new in the market. This will reduce the maintenance cost and downtime of bikes.</p>
