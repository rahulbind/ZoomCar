      								<h3>Purchasing The Vehicle</h3>
      								<ol id="purchasing">
      									<li class="heading">I have an existing car with me that I want to put on the ZAP platform. Is Zoomcar willing to accept that car?
      									</li>
      									<p class="answer">Unfortunately, currently we are not looking at bringing cars that are not brand new onto our platform, primarily due to the complexities of the regulatory framework we need to work under. At a future date, if regulation become more favourable, we may consider this.</p><li class="heading">Why is Zoomcar accepting only certain car models under ZAP?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Zoomcar now has significant experience with various car manufacturers and makes to know the quality of the car, running cost as well as the service network. We want you to benefit from this experience too and drive a car that is efficient and hassle-free to run. At the same time, providing these car makes to our customers ensures the quality of the experience they have. We have thus chosen a few car makes that we think run well. Further, these car models have great resale value in the market whenever you wish to sell them, which helps enhance your returns. As new car models come into the market, we will evaluate them and add them to the list.</p>
            							<li class="heading">Why does the invoice and registration of the car need to be under Zoomcar’s name? Doesn’t that mean that Zoomcar owns the car?</li>
            							<p class="answer">The requirement for registration of the car under Zoomcar’s name comes from the Motor Vehicles Act, which states that if a car is leased, it needs to be registered under the name of the lessee (in this case, Zoomcar). Further, the registration process mirrors the details on the purchase invoice of the car, which means that Zoomcar’s name must show up there too. However, it is very clear that you are in fact the owner of the car, given the fact that i) you have paid for the car, and ii) Zoomcar can only operate the car in accordance with the terms of the signed agreements, and you can in fact choose to stop running the car on the ZAP platform (with the notice period as per the agreements) and do whatever you want with it. Thus, actual ownership of the car is with you. Further, we explicitly acknowledge your ownership of the car in the documents we sign together.
            							The Supreme Court of India has also passed a judgment in the case of I.C.D.S. Ltd. vs. CIT (2013) that while the Motor Vehicle Act requires the vehicle to be registered under the lessee’s name, the owner of the vehicle remains the lessor, so your ownership of the vehicle will never come into question. </p>
            							<li class="heading">I want to take a loan for purchasing the car from my existing bank rather than Zoomcar’s financing partners. Is that possible?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Yes, you can take a loan from your own financing partner if you wish to purchase your car with a loan. However, note that the loan will have to be a personal loan and not a car loan. Otherwise, we are happy to connect you with our lending partners to finance your car purchase.</p>
            							<li class="heading">Can Zoomcar help me with the hassle of getting the car registration, permits & licenses, insurance, etc.?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Zoomcar values your time and will handle the entire process of purchasing the car (including accessories, insurance, RSA, etc.), registering it and getting all relevant licenses and permits (whether initially or renewals, thereafter), to make it hassle free for you. As per the agreements, however, you will be paying for the same (at cost – Zoomcar will not charge a markup or service fee for helping you with any of these) and also ensuring that the originals are placed in the car on time.</p>
            							<li class="heading">What in-car devices will Zoomcar be installing in the car?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Zoomcar installs certain devices in the car to give our customers a better experience and also assist our operations. Currently, we install a GPS-tracking device, a keyless entry (KLE) device and an engine immobilizer. Zoomcar will cover the entire cost of the devices and installation. However, you will be charged (at cost) for the monthly running cost of the device.

      								<h3>Cars Operation</h3>
      								<ol id="operation">
            							<li class="heading">Where will the car be parked?</li>
            							<p class="answer">For the duration that you will have the car in your possession, the car will be parked at your own parking location. For the duration that you give the car to Zoomcar for running on our platform, the car will be parked at Zoomcar’s chosen parking spot. A Zoomcar representative will come to pick up and drop the car at the designated times. However, if you choose to hand over and collect the car yourself from our site, you can do so too, and earn some extra revenue.</p>
            							<li class="heading">Who will take care of the maintenance of the car?</li>
            							<p class="answer">You will be responsible for maintaining the car and getting it serviced on time so that it is in good running condition for you as well as our customers. However, with our partnerships with workshops, we are able to get priority service at discounted prices, which we will look to pass on to you to reduce your cost of maintaining the car. Zoomcar will take the car from you in a clean condition with a full tank of fuel and return it the same way. If the car breaks down while it is with Zoomcar or one of our customers, we will get the car repaired but will pass on the bill to you for payment.</p>
            							<li class="heading">What happens if the car meets with an accident? What happens if the car is stolen?</li>
            							<p class="answer">We mandate that our Associates providing cars on the ZAP platform obtain acomprehensive insurance policy for the car that, apart from the standard own damage and third party coverage, includes coverage for zero depreciation, engine protection, consumables and theft. This ensures no exposure to you as well as Zoomcar in the unfortunate event of an accident. If the car undergoes an accident when the car is with Zoomcar or one of our customers, Zoomcar will manage the repair of the car and, if the repair time is over 24 hours, provide you with a replacement car for the duration the car is in the workshop. In the event the car is declared a total loss (i.e., the cost of repairing the car is close to or higher than the value of the car itself), the insurer will reimburse you the IDV (insurer coverage (under clause IMT 43). 
                                		In the event of an accident or unfortunate event with the car when it is in your possession, you will be responsible for getting the car repaired. However, our team will support you in the filing and processing of the insurance claim so you do not have to run around for the same.</p>
                                		<li class="heading">Why does Zoomcar require a Roadside Assistance Program (RSA) for the car?</li>
                                		<p class="answer">Zoomcar customers frequently take cars for outstation travel. In the event that the car breaks down for some reason, or meets with an accident in any location, whether in-city or outside, the RSA provider helps tow the car safely and quickly to the nearest workshop for repair. Ultimately this ensures that your car is safe and can get back on the road as soon as possible. In fact having an RSA on your car ensures peace of mind to you too when you travel out of the city.</p>
                                		<li class="heading">What happens if I don’t get the car back on time from Zoomcar?</li>
                                		<p class="answer">There could be instances where Zoomcar customers cause a delay in returning the car for various reasons, or the car breaks down and has to be taken to the workshop. This is totally outside of our control, unfortunately. However, in such case, to ensure you are not unduly affected, if the delay is under 24 hours, Zoomcar will reimburse you Rs. 100/hour for the duration that we were unable to return the car to you. If the delay is more than 24 hours, then we will provide you an alternate car till we are able to return your car to you.</p>
                                		<li class="heading">What happens if I am unable to give the car on time to Zoomcar?</li>
                                		<p class="answer">Zoomcar takes booking on cars available on our platform in advance. It is absolutely critical that we provide our customers cars on time to ensure the customer experience they expect of us. If for any reason you are unable to give the car on time to Zoomcar for a period, we will be charging you a flat fee of Rs. 5,000. However, if you notify us at least 48 hours in advance of the time of car handover of your inability to provide the car on time, we will not charge you any fee. This fee is to ensure that we are able to live up to our commitments to our customers.
                                		</p>
                                		<li class="heading">Will I have to take care of the renewals for insurance, road tax, RSA, etc. on the car?</li>
                                		<p class="answer">To make the process hassle free for you, Zoomcar will take care of all of these renewals. Of course, you will have to pay for these as per our agreement. We will inform you in advance of the renewals along with relevant quotes so you can prepare for the payments. Our only request would be that you pay for these in time and place the documents in the car on time to ensure you and our customers face no issues.</p>
                                		<li class="heading">Why is the term of the contract fixed at 30 months?
                                		</li>
                                		<p class="answer">We understand where you’re coming from. A typical privately owned car is run for 5-7 years before the owner decides to replace it. However, note that in our case, the utilization of the car will be higher since our customers will also be driving it when you’re not using it. This will mean more miles on the car in a shorter period of time. Ultimately, since you’ll be earning a significant amount from the car when our customers use it, this gives you the ability to replace the car earlier and get the latest model available in the market that time rather than drive an old model! However, if you still want to run the car after the term of the contract, you are free to do so.</p>
                                		<li class="heading">What happens at the end of the term of the contract?
                                		</li>
                                		<p class="answer">At the end of the term of the contract, Zoomcar will take out the devices we have installed in the car and stop offering it to our customers on our platform. If you desire to continue using the car on your own after the lease tenor is over, then we will help with re-registering the car in your name. If you desire to sell the car, we can assist you through our network to sell the car and achieve the best price possible.</p>

      								<h3>Financial Consideration</h3>
      								<ol id="financing">
      									<li class="heading">What returns can I expect from providing a car on ZAP? Are there any minimum amounts that Zoomcar will provide me?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Please refer to the financial model for details on projected returns from the program. Ultimately, the more time you provide the car on the Zoomcar platform, the more you earn from it. 
  										Given that the primary use of this car is going to be for your own usage, we will not be providing any minimum amount or fixed returns when you provide the car on our platform. Suffice to say though that our demand is robust enough that we don’t expect you to ever be unhappy with your earnings from providing the car on our platform.</p>
            							<li class="heading">What taxes are applicable on my earnings from Zoomcar?</li>
            							<p class="answer">VAT is chargeable on the amount Zoomcar will pay you monthly. If you are a registered dealer under VAT, then we will pay you the gross rental amount and you will be liable for depositing VAT with the authorities. If you are not a registered dealer, then Zoomcar will deduct the applicable VAT amount from the rentals and remit the balance to you. Service tax is not applicable on the rentals we pay you. Further, TDS at the applicable rate will be deducted from the payment Zoomcar makes to you. 
  										Note that since this rental income is classified as business income, you will be able to claim depreciation on the car and reduce your tax liability.</p>
            							<li class="heading">How will I know whether the monthly lease rental Zoomcar is paying me is correctly calculated?</li>
            							<p class="answer">Zoomcar follows a transparent process of maintaining records of the trip (including the corresponding revenue) and service and repair bills for calculating the monthly amount to be paid to you. We will also share copies of these bills with you so you can verify them yourself, if you so require. Over time, we will develop an "owner's app" which will allow you to check your car metrics in real-time. That will likely come only later this year however.</p>
